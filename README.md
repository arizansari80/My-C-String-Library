# c_generic_data_structure
The C Generic Data Structure Library

This will allow user to create Data Structure like Sets, Maps, Linked List, Stack, Queues etc in a generalized form.

The Sets Data Structure is implemented as an <b>Ordered Set</b> using a <b>Binary Search Tree (BST)</b> with log(n) times for all the operation insert, search

Same Way the Maps is also implemented as an <b>Ordered Map</b> using a <b>BST</b>.

Got the implement idea after using and analyze the working of the <b>qsort</b> function, that can be used to sort any kind of data type , whether it's a primitive data type or user defined datatype by taking a comparator function as one of it's argument an argument, this function can sort any type of data in any way. For reference of <b>qsort</b> see this <a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qsort</a>

For Sample Program Visit <a>https://github.com/arizansari80/c_generic_data_structure/blob/master/main.c</a>

Explanation of Set Init Function and it's argument

<b>Set.getSet(sizeof the elements, comparator function, display function)</b>
